# CS-320-Software-Testing

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing as much as possible, using JUnit tests and verifying that I am satisfying the requirements of the client.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By gathering as much information as possible and verifying it with the user/client. Having my team look it over before any work has begun.

How do I approach designing software?
I would use all my knowledge and experience to get a clear understanding of the needs of the user/client. I would begin with a strong foundation of a clear understanding of what is expected.
